# Atmospheric Ozone — Overview

Long-term monitoring of the ozone layer above the "Faraday / Akademik Vernadsky" station has been carried out since **1957**.  
After the transfer of the station to Ukraine in 1996, the monitoring was continued by Ukrainian scientists, ensuring a **continuous data series since 1957**.

### Measured parameters

- **Total Column Ozone (TCO, in Dobson Units)**;
- **Vertical distribution profile** (Umkehr observations).

Umkehr observations are possible only:

- under clear-sky conditions;
- at specific solar zenith angles (including sunrise and sunset).

Due to the geographic location (close to the Antarctic Circle, in a meteorologically active region), the frequency of Umkehr observations at the station is limited.
