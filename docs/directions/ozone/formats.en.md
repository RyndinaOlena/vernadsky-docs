# Data Formats and Data Centers (Ozone)

## Data Structures

Two categories are represented in the system:

### 1. Raw (primary) data

- direct observation results;
- technical information (temperature, observation conditions, etc.);
- purpose: error checking, reprocessing with other algorithms, analysis of instrument aging effects;
- access: for data providers, available **on request** through the administrator.

### 2. Scientific data

- published in appropriate units (e.g., TCO in Dobson Units);
- available to users through the web interface.
