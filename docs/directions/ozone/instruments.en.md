# Instruments — Dobson Spectrophotometer

## General Information

The main instrument for ozone monitoring at the station is the **Dobson spectrophotometer**.  
Only about 150 of these instruments were ever manufactured worldwide, each with its own unique number.

- Until 2004, the station operated spectrophotometer No. 31.  
- Since 2004, spectrophotometer No. 123 has been in use (still operational today).  

Dobson spectrophotometers are installed on all continents, forming a global network for monitoring the ozone layer.
