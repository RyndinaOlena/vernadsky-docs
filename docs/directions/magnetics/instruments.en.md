## Variometers

Since 2021, the main observatory instrument is the **LEMI-025 No. 063** variometer, developed and manufactured by the Lviv Center of the Institute for Space Research of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and the State Space Agency of Ukraine, installed along the geographic meridian (XYZ coordinates). It will be supplemented by a structurally identical **LEMI-025 No. 080** variometer, installed along the magnetic meridian (HDZ coordinates).

The **LEMI-025** model variometers have:

- time resolution: **1 s**
- polling interval: **0.1 s**
- very high sensitivity
- low level of internal noise
- built-in clock with automatic GPS synchronization
- data recording in **IAGA-2002** format

**Information from the developer:** <https://www.isr.lviv.ua/lemi025.htm>

Variometers of this model replaced their predecessors **LEMI-008 No. 002** and **No. 016** with a time resolution of 1 minute.

**Information from the developer:** <https://www.isr.lviv.ua/lemi008.htm>

## Scalar magnetometers

Scalar measurements of magnetic intensity are performed by a compact observatory magnetometer based on the Overhauser effect **GSM-90**, developed and manufactured by the Canadian company Gem Systems.

**GSM-90 characteristics:**

- continuous recording mode
- time resolution: **1 minute**
- polling frequency: every **5 seconds**

**Information from the developer:** <https://www.gemsys.ca/scalar-magnetometers/>

It replaced the Overhauser effect scalar magnetometer **POS-1** of Russian design.

## Absolute measurements

For absolute measurements, the following instruments are used:

- mechanical theodolite **T1** manufactured by the Swiss company Wild-Heerbrugg (currently defunct)
- single-axis flux-gate magnetometer **MAG-01H** manufactured by the British company Bartington
- scalar magnetometer-gradiometer based on the Overhauser effect **GSM-19** manufactured by the Canadian company Gem Systems

**Information from the MAG-01H developer:** <https://www.bartington.com/products/mag-01h/>

## Historical instruments

### Variometers

- **La Cour magnetograph**  
  Left over from the British. Originally there were 2 sets — rough and precise, at the time of the transfer 1 remained. Operated from **1957 to 2006**.

- **EDA FM-100B**  
  Left over from the British, 2 sets. Operated from **1974 to 2006**. In 2019, the last set was physically dismantled.

- **LEMI-008 No. 02**  
  HDZ coordinates, time resolution 1 min, polling frequency 1 s. Commissioning from 1998 to 2004, operation from 2004 to 2019. Failed in **May 2019**.

- **LEMI-008 No. 16**  
  XYZ coordinates, time resolution 1 min, polling frequency 1 s. Commissioning from 1998 to 2004, operation from 2004 to 2021. In reserve since **17 Feb 2021**, GPS clock synchronization does not work.

- **LEMI-025 No. 063**  
  Installed along the geographic meridian (XYZ coordinates). Time resolution 1 s, polling frequency 0.1 s. Commissioning since 2019, since **17 Feb 2021 it is the primary instrument**. Very high sensitivity, low level of internal noise, has its own GPS clock synchronization. Designed to work together with the POS-1 scalar magnetometer. Records data in **IAGA-2002** format.

- **LEMI-025 No. 080**  
  Planned to be installed along the magnetic meridian (HDZ coordinates), is structurally identical to the previous one.

### Magnetic theodolites

- **THEO-020B** with Bartington MAG-01H sensor  
  Left over from the British. Used until at least **2022**.

- **Wild T1** with MAG-01H sensor  
  Installed in **2022**, currently the main one.

### Scalar magnetometers

- **Barringer GM-122**  
  Canadian portable battery-powered proton magnetometer, left over from the British. Intended primarily for geological exploration. Used presumably from **1973-74 to 2005-06** for absolute measurements.

- **PMP-8**  
  Polish proton magnetometer. Used from **2005** until at least **2022** for absolute measurements.

- **POS-1**  
  Russian magnetometer based on the Overhauser effect. In operation since **2011**. Had a continuous recording mode. Had a design flaw in the form of an internal clock with a significant drift of about **0.2 s/day**. By its operating principle, it created parasitic signals that were recorded by variometers, which required complex procedures for synchronizing measurements and filtering data. At least until 2022, it was also used for absolute measurements.

- **GEM GSM-19**  
  Canadian magnetometer-gradiometer based on the Overhauser effect. In operation since at least **2022**.

- **GEM GSM-90**  
  Compact observatory variant of the GSM-19, featuring a continuous recording mode. In operation since at least **2022**.
