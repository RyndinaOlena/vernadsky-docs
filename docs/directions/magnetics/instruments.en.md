# Instruments (Geomagnetic Data)

## Variometers
- **LEMI-025 No.063** (Lviv Centre of Institute of Space Research, NASU & SSAU)  
  - main since 17.02.2021;  
  - installed along the geographic meridian (XYZ);  
  - resolution: 1 s, sampling: 0.1 s;  
  - high sensitivity, low intrinsic noise;  
  - GPS-synchronized clock;  
  - designed to work with scalar POS-1;  
  - data recorded in **IAGA-2002** format.  
- **LEMI-025 No.080**  
  - structurally identical to the previous one;  
  - to be installed along the magnetic meridian (HDZ);  
  - currently in the implementation stage.

## Scalar Magnetometers
- **GSM-90** (Gem Systems, Canada)  
  - compact observatory instrument;  
  - continuous recording with 1-minute resolution;  
  - sampled every 5 seconds.  
- **GSM-19** (Gem Systems, Canada)  
  - Overhauser-effect gradiometer;  
  - in operation since at least 2022.

## Magnetic Theodolites
- **Wild T1** (Wild-Heerbrugg, Switzerland) + **MAG-01H** sensor (Bartington, UK);  
  - installed in 2022;  
  - currently the main instrument for absolute measurements.
