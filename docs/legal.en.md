## Structure of Antarctic Research

Global coordination is carried out by **SCAR (Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research)**.  
Ukraine — associate member since 1994, full member since 2006 (with a break in 2017–2018).

The **Antarctic Treaty** (Art. III) provides for open exchange of scientific data.  
The **SCAR Data Policy** requires that data be made open as quickly as possible, with exceptions (protected species, personal data, etc.) and with proper metadata.

In Ukraine, research is conducted by specialized institutes of the NASU, universities of the Ministry of Education and Science, and other organizations — under the overall coordination of the **Ukrainian Antarctic Center (NANC)**.  
The State Program defines the main research areas (geology and geophysics, geospace, hydrometeorology, oceanography, biology, medicine, and physiology).
